things to consider when looking to use new tools
    what
        is it?
        problem does it solve?
    How
        does it work?
        did it come to be?
    When
        to use it?
        did it came out?
    Why
        use it?
    Who
        are the actors involved in and associated with the tool?
        are the authors?

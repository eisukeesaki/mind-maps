sessions
    what is it
        period of activity of user
           └─ between login and logout
        time delimited two-way link
        basic requirement to perform connection-oriented communication
    where is it
        (relatively high) layer in TCP/IP protocol
    what it allows to do
        interactive expression
        information exchange
            between two or more communicating devices
    typical properties
        statefulness
            one of the communicating parties must
                hold the current state information
                save session history

                what is it
                    state identifer
                        association of information with individual visitor
                implementation
                    use of
                        persistent storage
                            database
                                stores
                                    unique session identifer
                                    unique user identifier
                            example use case
                                shopping cart
                        volatile storage
                            RAM
                                reserve portion of RAM on the server to store states
                    common problems
                        distributed application server systems
                            every server in the cluster should share the state
                                methods of sharing session state
                                    multicast session data to member nodes
                                    ...
                    session state
                        data structure
                            key-value pair
                                key
                                    user identifier

                                use of random stirngs
                                associate visitor's IP address with generated session ID and lock it.
                    server-side web sessions
                        common problems
                            sharing of states
                            affected types of systems
                                load balancing systems
                                high availability systems
                    client-side web sessions
                        what does it do
                            maintains state without storing as much data on server
                        implementation
                            use
                                HTTP session tokens
                                    client usulally stores it as HTTP cookies
                                        current state data
                                cryptographic techniques
                            flow
                                - server sends state data to client
                                - with each successive requests, client sends state data to server
                                - server uses state data to remember state
                                - server makes appropriate response
                        common problems
                            tampering of session token by user or software
                            confidentiality
                                nothing apart from server should be able to interpret session token
                                    solution
                                        encrypt session token before sending to client
                            integrity
                                nothing apart from server should be able to manipulate session token
                                    solution
                                        make us of cryptographic techniques
                                            in a way that it will reveal alteration
                            authenticity
                                nothing apart from server should be able to initiate session
                            trade off
                                server disk space for extra bandwith use
                HTTP session token
                    identifies current session
                    generated by server
                    saved on client and sent to server in the forms of cookie
                web server session management
                    HTTP
                        stateless
                            client must establish new TCP connections with each new request
                            server cannot rely on an established TCP connection for no longer than a single HTTP operation
        HTTP/1.1 cookie header

How I build computer programs:
    1. identify the main issue that I want to solve
    2. define minimum viable solution for the main issue
    3. recursively break down the main issue into smaller, more specific sub-issues until I know the exact code-level solution for a particular issue
    4. code
        code a little, test a little, repeat
            sizeof "little" will incrementally become larger as my skill develops
    5. reassess issues
    6. repeat

```

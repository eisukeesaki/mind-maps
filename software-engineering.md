software engineering
    principles
        └─ foundation for system
        separation of concerns
        modularity
        abstration
            point of views towards software components
                behavior
                    what it does
                implementaion
                    how it does
        anticipation of change
        generality
        incremental development
        consistency

How I build computer programs:
    1. identify the main issue that I want to solve
    2. define minimum viable solution for the main issue
    3. recursively break down the main issue into smaller, more specific sub-issues until I know the exact code-level solution for a particular issue
    4. code
        code a little, test a little, repeat
            sizeof "little" will incrementally become larger as my skill develops
    5. reassess issues
    6. repeat

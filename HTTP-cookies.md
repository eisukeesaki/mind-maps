            use case
                user tracking
                    tracker can track target's activity on sites that features the trackers resource
                        with the use of HTTP referer header field
                    from the tracker's perspective, sites that features their resource is their teritory
        supercookie
            cookie with origin of top-level domain
            ordinary cookies have an origin of second level domain
        cookie wall
            a notification that indicates the use of cookies specifically, those that does not provide an option to reject it
            the user's consent to the use of cookies acts like a wall between the user and the resource that is being requested

    implementation
        requirements for browsers to support cookies
            can support
                cookies as large as 4096 bytes
                at least
                    50 cookies per domain
                    3000 cookies in total
        cookies are set by
            servers
                HTTP header specification
                    Set-Cookie header field
                        sent in an HTTP response from server
                        instructs browser to
                            ___ cookie ___
                                store, on client's computer
                                send back, to server in future requests to server
                can only be set on current resource's top domain and its subdomains
                    security reasons
                        not conforming to this would allow the issuer to have control over other domain's cookies
            clients
                JavsScript
                    document.cookie = "key=value"
            example request-response cycle
                where a server instructs browser to
                    save cookie on client's computer
                    send cookie to server with successive requests to server
                    request header
                        GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
                        Host: www.example.com

                        block cookie
                        whether to send cookie
            Domain and Path

                if not explicitly set
                    default to the domain and path of the requested resource
                        host-only cookie
                            user agent would only send cookie to its issuing domain
                if set
                    user agent would send cookie to its issuing domain AND its subdomains
            Expires and Max-Age
                Expires
                    defines specific date and time for when to delete cookie
                Max-Age
                    defines expiration of cookie as interval of seconds in the future
                        relative to the time the user agent received the cookie
            Secure and HttpOnly
                does not have associated values
                    presence of just these attribute indicates that their behaviors should be enabled
                Secure
                    directs user agents to use cookies only via encrypted connection
                    if a Secure cookie is set via non-encrypted connection, it can be intercepted
                        Secure attribute should be set over an encrypted connection
                HttpOnly
                    directs user agents not to expose cookies through channels other than HTTP and HTTPS
                    disables access to cookies by client-side scripting languages

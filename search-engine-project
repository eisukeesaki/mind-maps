MOTIVATION
==========

I want to search the web in a way that I want. I want to use a ranking algorithm of my own, which is tailored to suit my preferences. I want to see the web with my own intellectual eyes.

REQUIREMENTS
============

Create and host a website on AWS EC2.
When a end-user makes a request to fetch the contents at the root path of the website, the website's web server will return to the user agent, a HTML document consisting of an HTML form.
This form will be rendered on web browsers and used by human end-users to do a web search for the keyword `pizza`, and only for the word `pizza`.

On the back-end side of the website, the website will have at their disposal, records of inverted indexes that maps words in a particular HTML document body to the URL of that document.
The inverted indexes must be a product of a web crawler. The web crawler must take a seed file that specifies a list of URLs. It must automatically visit and download the HTML documents served at all given locations.

When the web server receives the search query (`pizza`) through an HTTP request, it will try to find in the indexe store, all the records that has the value `pizza` as their key. Then, the server must return the found list of records to the user agent that initiated the HTTP request.

Here are the list of websites to create an inverted index out of, and perform a search on:

        URL
            bobs-italian-restaurant.com
